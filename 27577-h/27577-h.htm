PREFACE TO<br />THE SEVENTH VOLUME.
</h2>
<div class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="typographical flourish" title="typographical flourish" /></div>


<p>
Of the seventy-three "Epigrams and Jeux d'Esprit," which are printed at
the commencement of this volume, forty-five were included in Murray's
one-volume edition of 1837, eighteen have been collected from various
publications, and ten are printed and published for the first time.</p>

<p>The "Devil's Drive," which appears in Moore's
<i>Letters and Journals</i>, and in the sixth volume of the Collected
Edition of 1831 as an "Unfinished Fragment"
of ninety-seven lines, is now printed and published for
the first time in its entirety (248 lines), from a MS. in
the possession of the Earl of Ilchester. "A Farewell
Petition to J. C. H. Esq.;" "My Boy Hobbie O;"
"[Love and Death];" and "Last Words on Greece,"
are reprinted from the first volume of <i>Murray's Magazine</i>
(1887).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
A few imperfect and worthless poems remain in MS.;
but with these and one or two other unimportant exceptions,
the present edition of the Poetical Works may
be regarded as complete.</p>

<p>In compiling a "Bibliography of the successive Editions
and Translations of Lord Byron's Poetical Works," I have
endeavoured, in the first instance, to give a full and
particular account of the collected editions and separate
issues of the poems and dramas which were open to
my inspection; and, secondly, to extract from general
bibliographies, catalogues of public and private libraries,
and other sources bibliographical records of editions
which I have been unable to examine, and were known
to me only at second-hand. It will be observed that
the <i>title-pages</i> of editions which have passed through my
hands are aligned; the <i>titles</i> of all other editions are
italicized.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend that this assortment of bibliographical
entries is even approximately exhaustive; but
as "a sample" of a bibliography it will, I trust, with
all its imperfections, be of service to the student of
literature, if not to the amateur or bibliophile. With
regard to nomenclature and other technicalities, my aim
has been to put the necessary information as clearly
and as concisely as possible, rather than to comply
with the requirements of this or that formula. But
the path of the bibliographer is beset with difficulties.
"Al Sirat's arch"&mdash;"the bridge of breadth narrower
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
than the thread of a famished spider, and sharper than
the edge of a sword" (see <i>The Giaour</i>, line 483, note 1)&mdash;
affords an easier and a safer foothold.</p>

<p>To the general reader a bibliography says little or
nothing; but, in one respect, a bibliography of Byron
is of popular import. It affords scientific proof of an
almost unexampled fame, of a far-reaching and still
potent influence. Teuton and Latin and Slav have taken
Byron to themselves, and have made him their own.
No other English poet except Shakespeare has been so
widely read and so frequently translated. Of <i>Manfred</i>
I reckon one Bohemian translation, two Danish, two
Dutch, three French, nine German, three Hungarian,
three Italian, two Polish, one Romaic, one Roumanian,
four Russian, and three Spanish translations, and, in
all probability, there are others which have escaped my
net. The question, the inevitable question, arises&mdash;What
was, what is, the secret of Byron's Continental
vogue? and why has his fame gone out into all lands?
Why did Goethe enshrine him, in the second part of
<i>Faust</i>, "as the representative of the modern
era ... undoubtedly to be regarded as the greatest genius of
our century?" (<i>Conversations of Goethe</i>, 1874, p. 265).</p>

<p>It is said, and with truth, that Byron's revolutionary
politics commended him to oppressed nationalities and
their sympathizers; that he was against "the
tramplers"&mdash;Castlereagh, and the Duke of Wellington, and the
Holy Alliance; that he stood for liberty. Another point
in his favour was his freedom from cant, his indifference
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to the pieties and proprieties of the Britannic Muse;
that he had the courage of his opinions. Doubtless in
a time of trouble he was welcomed as the champion of
revolt, but deeper reasons must be sought for an almost
exclusive preference for the works of one poet and a
comparative indifference to the works of his rivals and
contemporaries. He fulfilled another, perhaps a greater
ideal. An Englishman turns to poetry for the expression
in beautiful words of his happier and better feelings,
and he is not contented unless poetry tends to make
him happier or better&mdash;happier because better than he
would be otherwise. His favourite poems are psalms,
or at least metrical paraphrases, of life. Men of other
nations are less concerned about their feelings and their
souls. They regard the poet as the creator, the inventor,
the maker <i>par excellence</i>, and he who can imagine or
make the greatest <i>eidolon</i> is the greatest poet. <i>Childe
Harold</i> and <i>The Corsair</i>, <i>Mazeppa</i> and <i>Manfred,
Cain</i> and <i>Sardanapalus</i> were new creations, new types, forms
more real than living man, which appealed to their
artistic sense, and led their imaginations captive. "It
is a mark," says Goethe (<i>Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung
und Wahreit</i>, 1876, iii. 125), "of true poetry, that, as a
secular gospel, it knows how to free us from the earthly
burdens which press upon us, by inward serenity, by
outward charm.... The most lively, as well as the
gravest works have the same end&mdash;to moderate both pleasure
and pain through a happy mental representation."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
It is passion translated into action, the pageantry of
history, the transfiguration into visible lineaments of
living moods and breathing thoughts which are the notes
of this "secular gospel," and for one class of minds
work out a secular redemption.</p>

<p>It was not only the questionable belief that he was
on the side of the people, or his ethical and theological
audacities, or his prolonged Continental exile, which won
for Byron a greater name abroad than he has retained
at home; but the character of his poetry. "The English
may think of Byron as they please" (<i>Conversations of
Goethe</i>, 1874, p. 171), "but this is certain, that they can
show no poet who is to be compared to him. He
is different from all the others, and, for the most part,
greater." The English may think of him as they please!
and for them, or some of them, there is "a better
oenomel," a <i>vinum D&aelig;monum</i>, which Byron has not in
his gift. The evidence of a world-wide fame will not
endear a poet to a people and a generation who care
less for the matter than the manner of verse, or who
<i>believe</i> in poetry as the symbol or "<i>credo</i>" of the
imagination or the spirit; but it should arrest attention and invite
inquiry. A bibliography is a dull epilogue to a poet's
works, but it speaks with authority, and it speaks last.
<i>Finis coronat opus!</i></p>

<p>I must be permitted to renew my thanks to Mr. G. F.
Barwick, <i>Superintendent of the Reading Room</i>, Mr. Cyril
Davenport, and other officials of the British Museum, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
all grades and classes, for their generous and courteous
assistance in the preparation and completion of the
Bibliography. The consultation of many hundreds of
volumes of one author, and the permission to retain a
vast number in daily use, have entailed exceptional
labour on a section of the staff. I have every reason
to be grateful.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. A. W. Pollard, of the British
Museum, for advice and direction with regard to bibliographical
formulas; to Mr. G. L. Calderon, late of the
staff, for the collection and transcription of the title-pages
of Polish, Russian, and Servian translations; and to Mr.
R. Nisbet Bain for the supervision and correction of
the proofs of Slavonic titles.</p>

<p>To Mr. W. P. Courtney, the author of <i>Bibliotheca
Cornubiensis</i>, I owe many valuable hints and suggestions,
and the opportunity of consulting some important
works of reference.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere acknowledged the valuable information
with regard to certain rare editions and pamphlets
which I have received from Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B.</p>

<p>My especial thanks for laborious researches undertaken
on my behalf, and for information not otherwise
attainable, are due to M. J. E. Aynard, of Lyons; Signor
F. Bianco; Professor Max von F&ouml;rster, of Wurtzburg;
Professor Lajos Gurnesovitz, of Buda Pest; Dr. Holzhausen,
of Bonn; Mr. Leonard Mackall, of Berlin; Miss
Peacock; Miss K. Schlesinger; M. Voynich, of Soho
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
Square; Mr. Theodore Bartholomew, of the University
Library of Cambridge; Mr. T. D. Stewart, of the
Croydon Public Library; and the Librarians of Trinity
College, Cambridge, and University College, St. Andrews.</p>

<p>I have also to thank, for special and generous assistance,
Mr. J. P. Anderson, late of the British Museum,
the author of the "Bibliography of Byron's Works"
attached to the Life of Lord Byron by the Hon. Roden
Noel (1890); Miss Grace Reed, of Philadelphia, for
bibliographical entries of early American editions; and
Professor Vladimir Hrabar, of the University of Dorpat,
for the collection and transcription of numerous Russian
translations of Byron's Works.</p>

<p>To Messrs. Clowes, the printers of these volumes, and
to their reader, Mr. F. T. Peachey, I am greatly indebted
for the transcription of Slavonic titles included in the
Summary of the Bibliography, and for interesting and
useful information during the progress of the work.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must once more express my acknowment
of the industry and literary ability of my friend
Mr. F. E. Taylor, of Chertsey, who has read the proofs
of this and the six preceding volumes.</p>

<p>The Index is the work of Mr. C. Eastlake Smith.</p>

in 1799, at the house of a Mr. Gill. The name appears in a directory

Moore took down "these rhymes" from the lips of Byron's nurse,

<h3>A VERSION OF OSSIAN'S ADDRESS<br />
TO THE SUN.<br />
<span style="font-size:75%;">FROM THE POEM "CARTHON."</span></h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">O thou</span>! who rollest in yon azure field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round as the orb of my forefather's shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence are thy beams? From what eternal store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou, O Sun! thy vast effulgence pour?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In awful grandeur, when thou movest on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars start back and hide them in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pale Moon sickens in thy brightening blaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the western wave avoids thy gaze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone thou shinest forth&mdash;for who can rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companion of thy splendour in the skies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain oaks are seen to fall away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mountains themselves by length of years decay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ebbs and flows is the rough Ocean tost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven the Moon is for a season lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, amidst the fullness of thy joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same art ever, blazing in the sky!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When tempests wrap the world from pole to pole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When vivid lightnings flash and thunders roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou far above their utmost fury borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look'st forth in beauty, laughing them to scorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vainly now on me thy beauties blaze&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ossian no longer can enraptured gaze!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether at morn, in lucid lustre gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On eastern clouds thy yellow tresses play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else at eve, in radiant glory drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou tremblest at the portals of the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see no more! But thou mayest fail at length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Ossian lose thy beauty and thy strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him&mdash;but for a season&mdash;in thy sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shine with splendour, then to disappear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy years shall have an end, and thou no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright through the world enlivening radiance pour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sleep within thy clouds, and fail to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heedless when Morning calls thee to the skies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then now exult, O Sun! and gaily shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Youth and Strength and Beauty all are thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Age is dark, unlovely, as the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed by the Moon when clouds deform the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glimmering uncertain as they hurry past.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud o'er the plain is heard the northern blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mists shroud the hills, and 'neath the growing gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weary traveller shrinks and sighs for home.<br /></span>

sending me a copy of the foregoing <i>Version of Ossian's Address to
the Sun</i>, which was "Privately printed at the Press of Oliver B.
Graves, Cambridge, Massachusetts, June the Tenth, MDCCCXCVIII.,"
and was reprinted in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in December, 1898.
A prefatory note entitled, "From Lord Byron's Notes," is prefixed to
the Version: "In Lord Byron's copy of <i>The Poems of Ossian</i>
(printed by Dewick and Clarke, London, 1806), which, since 1874,
has been in the possession of the Library of Harvard University as
part of the Sumner Bequest. The notes which follow appear in
Byron's hand." (For the <i>Notes</i>, see the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,
1898, vol. lxxxii. pp. 810-814.)
</p><p>
It is strange that Byron should have made two versions (for
another "version" from the Newstead MSS., see <i>Poetical Works</i>,
1898, i. 229-231) of the "Address to the Sun," which forms the
conclusion of "Carthon;" but the Harvard version appears to be
genuine. It is to be noted that Byron appended to the earlier
version eighteen lines of his own composition, by way of moral or
application.]</p></div>

Byron and Moore supped on bread and cheese with Rogers. Their
host had just received from Lord Thurlow [Edward Hovell Thurlow,
1781-1829] a copy of his <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i> (1813), and
Byron lighted upon some lines to Rogers, "On the Poem of Mr.
<a name="Note_018" id="Note_018"></a>Rogers, entitled 'An Epistle to a Friend.'" The first stanza ran thus&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When Rogers o'er this labour bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their purest fire the Muses lent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T' illustrate this sweet argument."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<p>
"Byron," says Moore, "undertook to read it aloud;&mdash;but he
found it impossible to get beyond the first two words. Our laughter
had now increased to such a pitch that nothing could restrain it.
Two or three times he began; but no sooner had the words 'When
Rogers' passed his lips, than our fit burst forth afresh,&mdash;till even Mr.
Rogers himself ... found it impossible not to join us. A day or two
after, Lord Byron sent me the following:&mdash;'My dear Moore,
"When Rogers" must not see the enclosed, which I send for your
perusal.'"&mdash;<i>Life</i>, p. 181; <i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 211-213, note 1.]
</p><p>
Thurlow's poems are by no means contemptible. A sonnet, "To
a Bird, that haunted the Water of Lacken, in the Winter," which
Charles Lamb transcribed in one of Coleridge's note-books, should
be set over against the absurd lines, "On the Poems of Mr. Rogers."
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O melancholy bird, a winter's day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou standest by the margin of the pool;<br /></span>

"The Emperor had ordered the engineers to form fougades under
the grand bridge which is between Leipsic and Lindenau, in order
to blow it up at the latest moment, and thus to retard the march
of the enemy and give time to our baggage to file off. General
<a name="Note_024" id="Note_024"></a>Dulauloy had entrusted the operation to Colonel Montford. The
Colonel, instead of remaining on the spot to direct it, and to give
the signal, ordered a corporal and four sappers to blow up the
bridge the instant the enemy should appear. The corporal, an
ignorant fellow, and ill comprehending the nature of the duty with
which he was charged, upon hearing the first shot discharged from
the ramparts of the city, set fire to the fougades and blew up the
bridge. A part of the army was still on the other side, with a park
of 80 pieces of artillery and some hundreds of waggons. The
advance of this part of the army, who were approaching the bridge,
seeing it blow up, conceived it was in the power of the enemy. A
cry of dismay spread from rank to rank. 'The enemy are close
upon our rear, and the bridges are destroyed!' The unfortunate
soldiers dispersed, and endeavoured to effect their escape as well as
they could. The Duke of Tarentum swam across the river. Prince
Poniatowsky, mounted on a spirited horse, darted into the water
and appeared no more. The Emperor was not informed of this
disaster until it was too late to remedy it.... Colonel Montfort
and the corporal of the sappers have been handed over to a court-
martial."]

the Highlanders in 1745, chose to be particularly apprehensive of
personal violence, and shut herself up in a closet, in order that she
might escape ravishment. But no one came to disturb her solitude,
and ... by and by she popped her head out of her place of refuge
with the pretty question, 'Good folks, can you tell me when the
ravishing is going to begin?'" In 1813 Byron did not know Scott,
and must have stolen the jest from some older writer. It is, probably,
of untold antiquity.]

to the Club rules, the barouches were "yellow-bodied, with 'dickies,'
the horses bay, with rosettes at their heads, and the harness silver-mounted.
The members wore a drab coat reaching to the ankles,
with three tiers of pockets, and mother-o'-pearl buttons as large as
five-shilling pieces. The waistcoat was blue, with yellow stripes an
inch wide; breeches of plush, with strings and rosettes to each
knee; and it was <i>de rigueur</i> that the hat should be 3-1/2 inches deep in
the crown." (See <i>Driving</i>, by the Duke of Beaufort, K.G., 1894,

The discovery "that King Charles I. was buried in the vault of
King Henry VIII.," was made on completing the mausoleum which
George III. caused to be built in the tomb-house. The Prince
Regent was informed of the circumstance, and on April 1, 1813, the
day after the funeral of his mother-in-law, the Duchess of Brunswick,
he superintended in person the opening of the leaden coffin,
which bore the inscription, "King Charles, 1648" (<i>sic</i>). See <i>An
Account of what appeared on Opening the Coffin of King Charles the
First</i>, by Sir H. Halford, Bart., 1813, pp. 6, 7. Cornelia Knight,
in her <i>Autobiography</i> (1861, i. 227), notes that the frolic prince, the
"Adonis of fifty," who was in a good humour, and "had given to
Princess Charlotte the centre sapphire of Charles's crown," acted
"the manner of decapitation on my shoulders." He had "forgotten"
Cromwell, who, as Lord Auchinleck reminded Dr. Johnson, had
"gart kings ken that they had a <i>lith</i> in their neck!"]</p></div>

From June 6 to June 27, 1814, the Emperor of Russia, and the
King of Prussia were in England. Huge crowds watched all day
and night outside the Pulteney Hotel (105, Piccadilly), where the
Emperor of Russia stayed. Among the foreigners in London were
Nesselrode, Metternich, Bl&uuml;cher, and Platoff, Hetman of the Cossacks.
The two latter were the heroes of the mob.

The song was an impromptu, enclosed in a letter to Moore of
December 24, 1816. "I have written it principally," he says, "to

epigrams are included in "Po&eacute;sies Diverses," which are appended
to <i>Les jeux de Mains</i>, a poem in three cantos, published in 1808, and
were collected in his <i>Oeuvres Posthumes</i>, 1819; but there is no trace

</p><p>
The first edition of <i>Peter Bell</i> appeared early in 1819, and a
second edition followed in May, 1819. In Byron's Dedication of
<i>Marino Faliero</i>, "To Baron Goethe," dated October 20, 1820
(<i>Poetical Works</i>, 1891, iv. 341), the same allusions to Sir George
Beaumont, to Wordsworth's "place in the Excise," and to his
admission that <i>Peter Bell</i> had been withheld "for one and twenty
years," occur in an omitted paragraph first published, <i>Letters</i>, 1891,
v. 101. So close a correspondence of an unpublished fragment
with a genuine document leaves little doubt as to the composition of
the "Epilogue."]</p></div>

(see <i>Letters</i>, 1898, i. 163, note 1)
was committed to Newgate in December, 1819, for certain
passages in a pamphlet entitled, <i>A Trifling Mistake in Thomas
Lord Erskine's recent Preface</i>, which were voted (December 10) a
breach of privilege. He remained in prison till the dissolution on
the king's death, February 20, 1820, when he stood and was
returned for Westminster. Byron's Liberalism was intermittent, and
he felt, or, as Hobhouse thought, pretended to feel, as a Whig and
an aristocrat with regard to the free lances of the Radical party.
The sole charge in this "filthy ballad," which annoyed Hobhouse,
was that he had founded a Whig Club when he was an undergraduate
at Cambridge. He assured Murray (see his letter, November, 1820,
<i>Letters</i>, vol. iv. Appendix XI. pp. 498-500) that he was not the
founder of the club, and that Byron himself was a member. "As
for his Lordship's vulgar notions about the <i>mob</i>" he adds, "they
are very fit for the Poet of the <i>Morning Post</i>, and for nobody else."
There is no reason to suppose that Byron was in any way responsible
for the version as sent to the <i>Morning Post</i>.]

the City of London in 1818, but lost his seat to Sir William

Parliamentary friends of Hobhouse.

" ... The most splendid exhibition of the day was that of the
brass-founders and braziers. The procession was headed by a man
dressed in a suit of burnished plate armour of brass, and mounted
on a handsome black horse, the reins being held by pages ...
wearing brass helmets.... A man in a complete suite of brass
armour ... was followed by two persons, bearing on a cushion
a most magnificent imitation of the imperial Crown of England.
A small number of the deputation of brass-founders were admitted
to the presence of her Majesty, and one of the persons in armour
advanced to the throne, and bending on one knee, presented the
address, which was enclosed in a brass case of excellent
workmanship."&mdash;See <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 219, 220, note 2.
</p><p>
In a postscript to a letter to Murray, dated January 19, 1821,
he writes, "I sent you a line or two on the Braziers' Company last

Coleridge's Spring, 'slowly up this way.'"

Rector of Harrietsham and Woodchurch, a Prebendary of Winchester
and of Salisbury. He was Bampton Lecturer in 1802, and, soon
afterwards, was appointed sub-preceptor to the Princess Charlotte
of Wales. He was a connoisseur of architecture and painting, and
passed much of his time in Italy and at Rome. When he was at
Pisa he preached in a private room in the basement story of the
house in Pisa where Shelley was living, and fell under Byron's
displeasure for attacking the Satanic school, and denouncing <i>Cain</i> as
a blasphemous production. "The parsons," he told Moore (letter,
February 20, 1820), "preached at it [<i>Cain</i>] from Kentish Town to
Pisa." Hence the apostrophe to Dr. Nott. (See <i>Records of Shelley,
Byron, and the Author</i>, by E. T. Trelawny, 1887, pp. 302, 303.)]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_128_130" id="Footnote_128_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_128_130"><span class="label">[128]</span></a> [According to Lady Anne Hamilton (<i>Secret History of
the Court
of England</i>, 1832, i. 198-207), the Princess Charlotte incurred the
suspicion and displeasure of her uncles and her grandmother, the
Queen, by displaying an ardent and undue interest in her sub-preceptor.
On being reproved by the Queen for "condescending to
favour persons in low life with confidence or particular respect,
persons likely to take advantage of your simplicity and innocence,"
and having learnt that "persons" meant Mr. Nott, she replied by
threatening to sign a will in favour of her sub-preceptor, and by
actually making over to him by a deed her library, jewels, and all
<a name="Note_079" id="Note_079"></a>other private property. Lady Anne Hamilton is not an accurate
or trustworthy authority, but her extremely circumstantial narrative
was, no doubt, an expansion of the contemporary scandal to which
Byron's lampoon gave currency.]</p></div>

<p>"This copy purports on the title-page to be the fourth edition,
but is in truth the fifth. Having pointed out to Murray, the
bookseller, a variation between the copy of the fifth edition and
this, he borrowed it from me, that he might show it to Lord
Byron to have the circumstance explained; that his lordship told
him he had printed the fifth edition, but, before its publication,
having repented of the work altogether, he determined to destroy
the whole impression. But the printer, as he observed, must have
retained at least this one copy, and, by putting a false title-page,
had sold it as the fourth edition," etc.&mdash;<i>Notes and Queries</i>,

Epigram, written at the "Alfred," on <i>English Bards, etc.</i>,

<i>Note</i> (1).&mdash;A facsimile of the Title-page (2) faces p. xii. of vol. i.
of the <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1898. It has been alleged that large-paper
copies of this edition were issued from the Newark press. It is
certain that large copies (a copy in the British Museum, cut for
binding, measures 220 X 122), printed on paper bearing a water-mark
dated 1806, were thrown upon the market at an early
period, but it has not been ascertained at what date or in what
place they were printed. They are undoubtedly deliberate
forgeries. They purport, even in respect of <i>errata</i>, to be identical
with the genuine issue of 1807; but they were not set up
from the same type, and it is inconceivable that a second issue,
set up from different type and with slightly different ornaments,
was printed by Ridge for piratical purposes. To cite a few
obvious differences&mdash;in the title of the large-paper copies the
first A of the word "TRANSLATED" is printed
<span title='L'>&#923;</span>, and the
Greek
<span title='n'>&#957; </span> in
<span title='ainee'>&#945;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#949;</span>
and
<span title='neikei'>&#957;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#953;</span>
appears as
<span title='u'>&#965; </span>
(not
<span title='n'>&#957;</span>
reversed); in the
Errata on the reverse of p. xiii., [Page] "153 Note" is incorrectly
given as "163 Note," and this slip on the part of the
<i>falsarius</i> is more remarkable, as two other errata in the Errata
are carefully reproduced; in the Greek motto on p. 22 the letter
<span title='r'>&#961;</span>
twice appears as
<span title='s'>&#962; </span>; and, finally, the ornaments on pp. 1 and 187,
though intended to be, are not identical. In the Museum copy a
portrait of "Lord Byron, from a sketch taken on his leaving
England," engraved by I. West, and "Published by V. Hone,
Ludgate Hill, 1819," precedes the title-page, and, together with
the binding, affords good, if not conclusive, proof that this copy
was printed before 1820.</p>

<p>See, for a correspondence on these L.P. copies of 1807, the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, June, 1898, pp. 694, 695.</p>

<p>See, too, for further interesting and conclusive evidence that
the ornament on p. 187 of the L.P. copies was not printed from
the Newark block, <i>Newark as a Publishing Town</i>, by T. M.
Blagg, 1898, pp. 28-30.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> (2).&mdash;An autograph note, dated May 20th, 1812, signed
"Byron," is inserted on the fly-leaf of a large-paper copy in the
Rowfant Library (<i>Catalogue</i>, 1886, p. 144).</p>

<h4>Hints from Horace.</h4>

<div class="cocono">
<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;Two sets of proofs of a portion of <i>Hints from Horace</i>,
formerly the property of R. C. Dallas, are preserved in the British
Museum (<i>Eg</i>. 2029). Proof A consists of 100 lines of the English
translation (lines 173-272); Proof B, pp. [87]-128, consists of
272 lines of the English translation (lines 1-272) and (on opposite
pages) 188 lines of the original Latin. These proof-sheets, which
must have followed proofs of the Fifth Edition of <i>English Bards</i>,
<i>etc</i>., are preceded by a Half-title, <i>Hints from Horace</i> (Gothic
characters), and by the following subsidiary title:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hints from Horace:/ Being a/ Partial Imitation, in English
Verse, of the Epistle,/ "Ad Pisones de Arte Poetica;"/ And
intended as a Sequel to/ English Bards and Scotch Reviewers./
[Gothic characters.] "Ergo fungar vice Cotis, acutum/ Reddere
qu&aelig; ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secandi."/ Hor. De Arte Poet.
304-5./ "Rhymes are difficult things; they are stubborn things,
sir."/ Fielding's Amelia, Vol. III./ Book and Chap. V./
Athens, Franciscan Convent,/ March 12, 1811./</p>

<p>The publication of <i>Hints from Horace</i> had been entrusted by
Dallas to Cawthorn in July-August, 1811. It may be gathered
from various sources (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 24, 54, 56) that Byron was
at work on the proofs as late as September 4; that by October 11
he had resolved to defer the publication of the <i>Hints</i>; and that,
accordingly on October 13, 1811, "they stood still." It was not,
however, till after the appearance of <i>Childe Harold's</i>, <i>etc</i>.
(May-June, 1812) that Byron determined to suppress the already printed
Fifth Edition of <i>English Bards</i>, and at the same time to abandon
the publication of his two other Satires. At this time, says
Dallas (<i>Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron</i>, 1898, p. 241),
"the <i>Hints from Horace</i> was far advanced." In his <i>Recollections,
etc</i>. (pp. 104-113), he gives, by way of a "fair specimen," 156
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
"lines of the still-unpublished poem; and, as these extracts are
taken from the first 211 lines, and his text corresponds with
proof B (see Poetical Works, 1898, i. 390, variants ii., iii.), it may
be inferred that Dallas transcribed them from his fragmentary
proof-sheets, and that the press was stopped at line 272. In 1830,
in his <i>Notices of the Life of Lord Byron</i> (vol. i. pp. 263-269),
Moore printed 165 lines of the "Paraphrase;" but his selections
are drawn from lines 1-458, and it is evident that he had access
to an original MS. (<i>MS. M.</i>), which is now in Mr. Murray's
possession. The full text, which follows the same MS., was first
published in vol. v. pp. 273-327 of the six-volume edition of 1831
(<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Page_110">No. xliii.</a> of "Collected Editions").</p>
</div>

<h4>The Irish Avatar</h4>

<div class="cocono">
<p>Byron wrote the <i>Irish Avatar</i> at Ravenna, September 16, 1821.
On the 17th he sent a copy of the verses to Moore, then resident
at Paris; and on September 20 he desired Moore to get "twenty
copies of the whole carefully and privately printed off." A copy
is in the possession of Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B., and I am
indebted to his kindness for the following description: "The
pamphlet consists of four 8vo leaves, viz. half-title ('The Irish
Avatar,' in bold capitals, with blank verse), pp. [1], [2] + Text,
pp. 3-8. The poem begins on the third page with a dropped head,
'The Irish Avatar' again, and the first four verses. Pp. 4-7 contain
six verses each, and p. 8 the remaining four, making up thirty-two
in all. The date at the end of p. 8 is 'September 16, 1821.'
There is no title-page proper; a headline, 'The Irish Avatar,'
occurs on pp. 4-8, which pages are numbered in Arabic figures in
the outside corners, and the thirty-two stanzas are also numbered
in Arabic figures. The poem is printed on a half-sheet of a
peculiar fine-ribbed paper." Twenty stanzas of <i>The Irish Avatar</i>
were printed by Medwin in <i>Conversations of Lord Byron</i>, 1824,
pp. 216-220, and in a second edition, 1824, pp. 332-338. In a
"new edition" of the <i>Conversations, etc.</i>, 1824, pp. 264-270, the
entire poem, numbering thirty-two stanzas, was published for the
first time in England (see <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, July 27, 1901). <i>The Irish
Avatar</i> was first published by Murray in 1831 (Works, vi. 419-425).</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Leonard L.
Mackall, of Berlin, for the substance of the following note on this
work:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pages 213-233 of the Anmerkungen" are devoted to an essay
on the play as a whole. This essay is evidently the "Appendix to
an English Work," to which Byron refers in the letter accompanying
the suppressed Dedication to <i>Marino Faliero</i>. "In the Appendix
to an English Work, lately translated into German, and published
at Leipzig, a judgment of yours upon English poetry is quoted as
follows: 'That in English poetry great genius, universal power,
a feeling of profundity, with sufficient tenderness and force are to
be found, but that altogether these do not constitute poets,'" etc.,
etc. (see <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1901, v. 340, 341, and <i>Letters</i>, 1900, v.
100-103). The originals of the Dedication and Letters were conveyed
to Goethe by John Murray the third, in 1830 (? 1831) (see
<i>Goethe-Jahrbuch</i>, 1899, xx. pp. 31-35, where the "Dedication"
is printed in full for the first time), and are preserved at Weimar in
the "red portfolio" (cf. <i>Eckermann</i>, March 26, 1826), in which
Goethe kept all his papers connected with Byron. The "judgments"
quoted by Byron through "an Italian abstract" from
Wagner's Appendix (pp. 217-218) there read <i>inaccurately</i> as
follows: "In der Englischen Poesie," sagt Goethe, "man findet
durchaus einen grossen, t&uuml;chtigen, weltge&uuml;bten Verstand, ein tiefes,
zartes, Gem&uuml;th, ein vortreffliches Wollen, ein leidenschaftliches
Wirken ... das alles zuzammengenommen macht noch keinen
Poeten ... nach dieser Ansicht zeigen die meisten Englischen
Gedichte einen d&uuml;stern Ueberdruss des Lebens." These sentences,
which should be read in the light of the context, will be found in
Goethe's <i>Dichtung und Wahrheit</i>, Th. iii. Buch. 13 (1814, now
Wirke, Weimar ed. xxviii. 213, 214), the book (<i>Aus meinem Leben,
Dichtung und Wahrheit</i>), which is held up to ridicule in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, June, 1816, vol. xxvi. pp. 304-317.</p>

<div class="cocono">
<p>The following note was attached to the "Dedication" which
was prefixed to the First Canto in 1833 (<i>Works</i>, 1833, xv. 101):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Note(1). [This 'Dedication' was suppressed in 1819, with
Lord Byron's reluctant consent; but, shortly after his death, its
existence became notorious, in consequence of an article in the
<i>Westminster Review</i>, generally ascribed to Sir John Hobhouse,
and for several years the verses have been selling in the streets as
a broadside. It could therefore serve no purpose to exclude them
on the present occasion.]" See, too, <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1903, vi. 3.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. H. Buxton Forman,
C.B., for the following description of one of these "broadsides,"
now in his possession:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Single sheet foolscap 8vo, consisting of Half-title, 'Dedication/
to/Don Juan,/' with Imprint on verso ('London:/ printed
by C. and W. Reynell, Broad Street,/ Golden Square'); Title-page,
'Dedication/ to/ Don Juan./ by/ Lord Byron./ London:/
Published by Effingham Wilson,/Royal Exchange./ 1833./' On
the verso of this is a note&mdash;</p>

<p>"'[<i>Why the following Dedication did not appear with the two

<p>"The first page of the Text (p. 5, but not numbered) contains
the dropped head 'Don Juan./ Dedication.' and one stanza.
Pp. 6-10 contain two stanzas each, and p. 11 one. The headline
'Don Juan' runs from p. 6 to p. 11, and the stanzas are numbered
in Roman capital figures. P. 12 is blank, and is followed by a
Half-title, 'Notes,' with a blank verso. The Notes occupy
pp. 15 and 16, of which 15 is not numbered, but has a dropped
head, 'Notes.' Page 16 is numbered, and has the headline
'Notes.'"</p>

<h3 style="letter-spacing:0;"><i>Note</i> (1).&mdash;<span class="smcap">On Genuine and Spurious Issues
of "English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers</span>."</h3>

<div class="cocono">

<p>Among the first who called attention to the "inextricable tangle"
of the several editions of <i>English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers</i> was
Mr. Leicester Warren, better known as Lord de Tabley, who communicated
some notes in 1877 to <i>Notes and Queries</i> (Series V.
vol. vii. pp. 145, etc.); but it was reserved to the late Mr. Dykes
Campbell, Mr. Bertram Dobell, and other correspondents to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (May 5 to July 7, 1894), to point out that the problem
was still farther complicated by the existence of spurious issues of at
least three out of the five or six distinct editions of the Satire.</p>

<p>All editions, genuine or spurious, claim as their publisher "James
Cawthorn, British Library, No. 24 Cockspur Street," but different
printers were employed. The First Edition bears the imprint of
"T. Collins, Printer, No. 1, Harvey's Buildings, Strand;" the
Second Edition, that of "Deans and Co. Hart Street, Covent
Garden;" the Third Edition, that of "T. Collins," etc.; the Fourth
Edition of 1810, that of "T. Collins," etc.; the Fourth
Edition of 1811 ("James Cawthorn and Sharpe and Hailes"), that
of "Cox, Son, and Baylis, Great Queen Street, London." No
printer's name was attached to the suppressed Fifth Edition of 1812.</p>

<p>Genuine First Editions have the water-mark, "E. and P. 1804,"
or "E. and P. 1805," or, possibly, no water-mark at all. A copy
of the spurious First Edition, in Mr. Murray's possession, has the
water-mark, "S. and C. Wise, 1812." In addition to at least eleven
variants in punctuation, the spurious copy prints (p. 5, line 47)
"Wizzard" (p. 20 <i>n</i>.), "M<i>e</i>deira," and, in the same note,
"Anna d'Afert;" whereas the genuine copies print correctly "Wizard,"
"Madeira," and "Anna d'Arfet."</p>

<p>A genuine copy of the Second Edition, which belonged to the
late Mr. Dykes Campbell, bears the water-mark "Budgen and
Willmot, 1808." On p. 80, line 1007, "Abedeen" is misprinted for
"Aberdeen;" and the same misprint occurs in a copy of the Second
Edition in the British Museum. In all probability there was no
spurious issue of the Second Edition.</p>

<p>Of the Third Edition (1810), copies bearing the water-mark,
"E.&amp;P. 1804," or "G.&amp;R.T.," may be regarded as genuine&mdash;rare
exceptions among a host of forgeries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
which either lack a water-mark
altogether or bear water-marks of a later period. Mr. Gilbert R.
Redgrave, in an article (<i>The Library</i>, December 1, 1899, Series II.
vol. i. pp. 18-25), notes two distinct and divergent forgeries bearing
the water-mark "Pine, and Thomas, 1812." Forgery A prints
"myse" for "muse" (line 4), "rove" for "rave" (line 384), etc.;
while forgery B, in a footnote to p. 30, prints "Bowle'ss" for
"Bowles's," and, at the end of p. 85, "we" for "me," and
"farther" for "further." Other copies bear the water-marks,
"Allnutt, 1816," "Smith &amp; Allnutt, 1816," "Ivy Mills, 1817," and
"I.&amp;R. Ansell, 1818." A copy of a spurious issue of the Third
Edition in the British Museum prints "crawl" for "scrawl" (line
47), and "p. 73" for "p. 85."</p>

<p>It has been surmised, but conclusive proof is not forthcoming,
that a so-called Fourth Edition of 1810 (1050 lines), which purports
to have been published by James Cawthorn, and bears the imprint,
"<i>Printed by J. Collins, Harvey's Buildings, Strand, London</i>," is a
spurious issue. It is practically a reprint of the Third Edition; but
in some copies there are misprints not to be found in other
piracies&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> "crouds" for "crowds" (line 269),
and "alter" for "altar"(line 285).</p>

<p>Copies of the Fourth Edition of 1810, which may possibly be
genuine, bear a water-mark, "G.&amp;R.T.," or are on plain paper.
Copies which are manifestly forgeries bear the water-marks, "J.X.
1810" and "W. Pickering, 1816."</p>

<p>A second Fourth Edition (1052 lines), published by "James Cawthorn
and Sharp &amp; Hailes, 1811," and printed by "Cox, Son, &amp;
Baylis," was certainly recognized by Byron as a genuine Fourth
Edition, and must have passed through his hands, or been subject
to his emendation, before it was sent to press. Copies of this edition
bear his MS. emendations of 1811-1812, and marginal notes of
1816. Genuine copies (<i>e.g.</i> Leigh Hunt's copy, now in the Forster
Collection at the South Kensington Museum) are printed on paper
bearing a water-mark, "J. Whatman, 1805." There was, however,
another issue of the Fourth Edition of 1811, printed on plain paper.
Mr. Redgrave notes certain minute differences between these two
issues. In the edition on plain paper there is a hyphen to "Cockspur-Street"
on the title-page, and the word "Street" is followed by a
comma instead of a semicolon. Again, in the plain-paper copies
"Lambe" is spelt with an <i>e</i>, and in the water-mark copies the word
is correctly spelt "Lamb." In the plain-paper copies the misprint
"Postcript" for "Postscript" is repeated, and in the copies bearing
a water-mark the word is correctly spelt "Postscript." There are
other differences in the advertisements at the end of the volume.</p>

<p>A spurious Fourth Edition in Mr. Murray's possession, which has
been enriched with a series of prints of persons and places, bears the
water-marks, "1811," "1814." Each page has been inserted into
a folio sheet bearing the water-mark, "J. Whatman, 1816." A
full-sized octavo, in small print (B.M. 11645 P. 15), which purports
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
to be the Fourth Edition of 1811, is probably spurious. It is the
survival of a distinct issue from other genuine or spurious copies of
the Fourth Edition.</p>

<p>The spurious issues of the Third and Fourth Editions, whether
they were printed in Ireland or were secretly thrown upon the
market by James Cawthorn after Byron had definitely selected
Murray as his publisher, were designed for the general reader and
not for the collector. The issue of a spurious First Edition after
the improved and enlarged editions of 1809-11 were published,
must have been designed for the Byron enthusiast, if not the collector
of First Editions.</p>

<p>The Grangerized Fourth Editions prepared by Mr. W. M. Tartt
and Mr. Evans in 1819, 1820, and a Third, by John Murray at
about the same period, and, more remarkable still, a copy of the
Fourth Edition of 1811, prefaced by a specially printed "List of
Names mentioned in the <i>English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers</i>"
interleaved with the additions made in the Fifth Edition (B.M.),
point to the existence of a circle of worshippers who were prepared
to treat Byron's <i>Juvenilia</i> as seriously as the minute critics of the
present generation. They seem to have been sufficiently numerous
to make piracy, if not forgery, profitable.</p>

are extant&mdash;one in Mr. Murray's possession, and a second in the
Forster Library at the South Kensington Museum. The former,
which contains the marginal comments marked "B. 1816," has
been assumed to have been prepared as a press copy for the Fifth
Edition; but, as the following collation reveals, the latter, which
belonged to Leigh Hunt, represents a fuller and later, though not
